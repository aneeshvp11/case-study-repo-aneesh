An International logistics company is looking towards making their deliveries more agile and high speed 
and to achieve this, they wanted to drive their application lifecycle management through their devops 
initiatives. With hundreds of 
developers working across remote locations in different timezones and their 
old traditional development methods needed to be rewritten, super agile git helped them achieve better 
market agility and win more customers. Git transformed how they used to code 
and that helped them 
manage their ALM better.
